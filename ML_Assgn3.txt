#QUesrtion1
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn,
gradually improving its accuracy.
1.Fraud Detection
Data scientists use machine learning to understand an individual customer's typical behavior, such as when and where the customer uses a credit card. Machine learning can take that  information, as well as other data sets, to accurately determine in mere milliseconds which transactions fall within the normal range and are therefore legitimate versus which 
transactions are outside expected norms and therefore are likely fraudulent.

2.Dynamic Pricing
Companies can mine their historical pricing data along with data sets on a host of other variables to understand how certain dynamics -- from time of day to weather to the seasons impact demand for goods and services. Machine learning algorithms can learn from that information and combine that insight with additional market and consumer data to help companies dynamically price their goods based on those vast and numerous variables -- a strategy that ultimately helps companies maximize revenue.


#Question2
1.Under supervision of experts 
Human learning which involves direct guidance and supervision under an expert of any field. The expert can be an individual or any organisation which maintains direct contact with the
one learning.

2.Assistance of experts in an indirect manner
Indirect guidance is provided through learners actively observing, listening, and engaging with social practices and norms, which serve to furnish models and goals for performance and individuals' learning.

3.Self Education
Self-learning is an approach to learning where the individual makes the effort to identify their own learning needs, set learning goals, find the necessary resources, and evaluate 
their own knowledge.

#Question4
There are mainly 3 types of machine learning 
1. Supervised
2. Unsupervised 
3. Reinforcement


#Question5
A computer program is said to learn from Experience E when given a task T, and some performance measure P. If it performs on T with a performance measure P, then it upgrades with experience E. 
Thus, A problem is well-posed if a solution to it exists, if that solution is unique, and if that solution depends on the data / experience but it is not sensitive to (reasonably small) changes in the data / experience.
To have a well-defined learning problem, three features needs to be identified: 

1. The class of tasks(T)
2. The measure of performance to be improved(P)
3. The source of experience(E) 





#QUestion6
No , ML cannot solve all, of our problems and if not implemented properly or poorly can result in major issues.
The problems can be of ethical nature such as tendency to trusting algorithm and statistical data more than human judgement and logic in evry case or blindly trusting technology like
self driving cars which can result in fatal accidents.
THen there are deterministic problems and problems such as lack of data which essentially means that low amounts of data fed to the ML model can result in erroneous results and poor
performance. There can also be a common problem such misutilization.





#Question7
1.Linear Regression
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
The core idea is to obtain a line that best fits the data. The best fit line is the one for which total prediction error (all data points) are as small as possible. Error is the distance between the point to the regression line.
The perfomance metrics is deternmined by the mean squared error and gradient descent wherein the lower the mean squared error about the best fit line the better is the model.

2. Random Forest
Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset." Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and it predicts the final output.
The Working process can be explained in the below steps and diagram:
Step-1: Select random K data points from the training set.
Step-2: Build the decision trees associated with the selected data points (Subsets).
Step-3: Choose the number N for decision trees that you want to build.
Step-4: Repeat Step 1 & 2.
Step-5: For new data points, find the predictions of each decision tree, and assign the new data points to the category that wins the majority votes.
The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.






#Question8
Supervised learning can be broadly defined in two types :-
1. Regression
Regression algorithms are used if there is a relationship between the input variable and the output variable. It is used for the prediction of continuous variables, such as Weather forecasting, Market Trends, etc. Some of the popular regression algorithms used are 
-Linear Regression
-Decision Trees
-Bayesian Linear Regression
-Logistic Regression




2. Classification
Classification algorithms are used when the output variable is categorical, which means there are two classes such as Yes-No, Male-Female, True-false, etc. Some of the popular 
-Random Forest
-Decision Trees
-Logistic Regression
-Support vector Machines







#Question9
-> UNSUPERVISED ML  
Assume, we have taken an unlabeled input data of animals, which means it is not categorized and corresponding outputs are also not given. Now, this unlabeled input data is fed to the machine learning model in order to train it. Firstly, it will interpret the raw data to find the hidden patterns from the data and then will apply suitable algorithms such as k-means clustering, Decision tree, etc.
Once it applies the suitable algorithm, the algorithm divides the data objects into groups according to the similarities and difference between the objects. This means the output we will 
receive will be in the form of categories such as dogs, cats, birds etc.

->SUPERVISED ML
Suppose we have a dataset of different types of shapes which includes square, rectangle, triangle, and Polygon. Now the first step is that we need to train the model for each shape.
If the given shape has four sides, and all the sides are equal, then it will be labelled as a Square.
If the given shape has three sides, then it will be labelled as a triangle.
If the given shape has six equal sides then it will be labelled as hexagon.
Now, after training, we test our model using the test set, and the task of the model is to identify the shape.

The machine is already trained on all types of shapes, and when it finds a new shape, it classifies the shape on the bases of a number of sides, and predicts the output.
Now that the machine is already trained on all types of shapes, and when it finds a new shape, it classifies the shape on the bases of a number of sides, and predicts the output.







#Question10
-> SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION 
In a simple linear regression, there is one independent variable and one dependent variable. The model estimates the slope and intercept of the line of best fit, which represents the relationship between the variables. The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable, while the intercept represents the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. If there is a single input variable X(independent variable), such linear regression is called simple linear regression.

The best fit line is a line that fits the given scatter plot in the best way. Mathematically, the best fit line is obtained by minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares(RSS). The main aim of simple linear regression is to find this line.To help us find this line we use the cost function.

The cost function helps to work out the optimal values for B0 and B1, which provides the best fit line for the data points.
In Linear Regression, generally Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function is used, which is the average of squared error that occurred between the y^predicted and y^i.

To further optimize the model we use the optimizatiojn technique of gradient descent.
Gradient Descent is one of the optimization algorithms that optimize the cost function(objective function) to reach the optimal minimal solution. To find the optimum solution we need to reduce the cost function(MSE) for all data points. This is done by updating the values of B0 and B1 iteratively until we get an optimal solution.

The strength of any linear regression model can be assessed using various evaluation metrics. These evaluation metrics usually provide a measure of how well the observed outputs are being generated by the model.
The most used metrics are,
1. Coefficient of Determination or R-Squared (R2)
2. Root Mean Squared Error (RSME) and Residual Standard Error (RSE)


-> Market Basket Analysis 
Market basket analysis in data mining is a kind of data analytics that pinpoints the goods or things that people usually buy together. In order to comprehend consumer behavior and pinpoint product combinations that are well-liked by clients, this study is typically carried out in the retail sector. The outcomes of a market basket study may be utilized for a variety of tasks, including developing specialized marketing campaigns, enhancing product placement in stores, and enhancing inventory control.

Market basket analysis is a useful technique for retailers because it enables them to understand the linkages between various items and uncover chances to enhance sales and improve customer happiness. Retailers may make educated judgments about product placement, promotions, and price by identifying what things are often purchased together, which can lead to more revenue and enhanced consumer loyalty.

For example :- 
A grocery store evaluating customer purchase data to discover which goods are usually purchased together is a real-world example of market basket analysis. Customers who buy bread may also buy peanut butter, jelly, and bananas, according to the study. With this knowledge, the retailer may make modifications to improve sales of these products, such as positioning them near each other on the shelf or providing discounts when consumers purchase all four items together.

Market basket analysis is classified into two types:
1. Predictive Market Basket Analysis - to identify items that are likely to be purchased together and use this information to inform business decisions such as product placement, marketing strategies, and inventory management.
2. Differential Market Basket Analysis - generally used to understand the purchasing behavior of customers, as well as to identify trends and patterns in sales data.
